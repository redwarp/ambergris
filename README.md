# Ambregris

![Rust](https://github.com/redwarp/ambergris/workflows/Rust/badge.svg?branch=main)

Your generic/boring rogue experience, following a bunch of tutorials:

- https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/
- https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/rustbook/chapter_0.html

Why Ambregris? I think it's as generic of a name as can be! It hints at some mysterious substance, that might do wonders. (And is actually just a type of amber, that floats and burns well, and comes from sperm whale. Probably the lamest of ambers.)
